  	 <h2>Novi Sad, Serbia</h2>

  	 <p>Novi Sad may be the second largest city in Serbia, but those expecting the same experience as the chaotic capital are going to be in for an entirely different kind of shock. The Vojvodinian capital is a very different city compared to Belgrade, one with a different history and a different architecture to boot. Sat in the centre of one of Serbia’s prettiest regions with some of its most gorgeous villages, Novi Sad is worth a visit all on its own – and here is why.
<br> </br>
Ironically, the most visited tourist attraction in Novi Sad isn’t exactly in the city proper. Petrovaradin Fortress is on the other side of the river in the municipality of the same name, although it is inherently linked to the big city across the Danube. Work on the fortress began in 1682 and ended nearly a century later in 1780, with that whole ‘war’ thing causing most of the disruptions.

  	  <h2>Kaunas, Lithuania</h2>
  	 <p>Kaunas, Lithuania’s second largest city, holds many surprises even for experienced travellers.
You may be wondering, is Kaunas worth visiting? Vilnius, Lithuania's first city, is a much loved UNESCO Heritage Site with tons to see and do. Kaunas on the other hand is an often overlooked weekend destination. I spoke to a colleague from Lithuania before our weekend city break to his country and mentioned that we would be splitting our time between Vilnius and Kaunas. He arched an eyebrow which seemed to say why would you go to Kaunas? 

One of the reasons that we added Kaunas to our weekend itinerary was because the timing and travel logistics were better for the trip to fly from Dublin into Vilnius and then to fly out of Kaunas back to Dublin. Kaunas to Vilnius is only about 100 km. Despite my colleague seeming to imply that Kaunas was not worth visiting, we went ahead with our plan to visit Kaunas for the weekend anyway. We're so glad we did. Here are ten reasons why Kaunas is worth visiting for the weekend if you're in the neighborhood (e.g., planning a trip to Vilnius).
