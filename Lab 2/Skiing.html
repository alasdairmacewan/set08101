<h2 style="background-color:blue;color:white">Planning your trip</h2>
<p>
The unpredictability of good conditions can mean that when everything comes together Scottish ski slopes are swamped with skiers and boarders. This is particularly the case at weekends and during school and public holidays. The advice, if you must visit at a busy time, is to arrive early and book your rentals and lift ticket in advance. Otherwise you can face a succession of delays on top of the long queue to get on the lift – a combined wait of several hours potentially and very crowded slopes at the top.

Parking can also be an issue at Glenshee (which limits numbers) and Cairngorm, where the slopeside car park can fill up, meaning a shuttle-bus ride from the overflow car park. Avoiding the peak lunch hours in the mountain restaurants is also advisable.

<h2> Lift Passes: How Much Do They Cost?</h2>
<p>Lift passes tend to be sold by the day, although multi-day passes are available and an all-area pass is sold in the autumn. Prices are not a lot less than for larger ski resorts in the Alps, perhaps because of the fact that the centres need to get the money in to help get through the lean periods. In-resort costs are closer to the norm throughout Britain and not hiked up as they can be in Alpine resorts.</p>

<h1>For the Best Trip</h1>
<p>List the year-round tourist assets for the Scottish Highlands and you’ll soon realise they’re world-beating. So if you do plan a visit in advance, keeping an open mind about how much actual skiing you’ll be able to do, you certainly won’t be bored.

Attractions include Loch Ness, Balmoral, the Moray Firth dolphins, and the many whisky distilleries. Then there’s a vast choice of activities including hiking, climbing and mountain biking. All these attractions make a Scottish ski holiday a good choice for families or groups with non-skiers in the party.</p>
