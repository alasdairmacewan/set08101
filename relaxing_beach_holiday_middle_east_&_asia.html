  	 <h2>Thailand</h2>

  	 <p>In Thailand, Koh Yao is a group of two islands that sit in Phang Nga Bay, just a quick boat ride away from Phuket. If the busy, long stretches of sand you find in Phuket are too much for you, Koh Yao, with its windswept white sands and open views across the bay, will offer a welcome getaway.
<br> </br>
The Koh Yao islands are home to several small beaches, all fairly quiet, most of them reached only after a walk on dirt roads with no signs of civilization around. Laem Had Beach is perhaps the best known of all, a rarely crowded stretch of white sand that offers great swimming and some of the best snorkeling in the country.
<br> </br>
Tha Khao Bay beach, on the other hand, is the place to visit for quiet solitudeâ€“no sports activities here and few, if any, sunbathers; just the rocking of longtail boats as the waves crash over the sand.

  	  <h2>Miyako Island, Japan</h2>
  	 <p>Because of their remote location and unique ecosystem, with no inland rivers eroding the ground and damaging the coral reef, the beaches on Miyako Island are some of the most unspoiled ones on the planet.
<br> </br>
Miyako beaches are also tranquil and offbeat, a sweet break from the chaos you usually find in tropical beaches. Still a secret to many visitors to Japan, the Miyako islands offer a way to escape the crowds and still bury your toes in the sand.
<br> </br>
With turquoise-blue waters and soft sand dunes, Maehama is the island's largest stretch of beach and one of the most breathtaking. Maehama is popular with swimmers but also locals wanting to catch the sunset over the waves. Another nice beach on the island is Yoshino Kaigan, a popular snorkeling destination because of its massive coral reef and colorful aquatic life.
