  	 <h2>Perhentian Islands, Malaysia</h2>

  	 <p>Located just off the coast of Malaysia, the two islands that make up the Perhentian have a lot to offer. Besar, the larger of the two, is where the main resorts and infrastructure are located, with plenty of palm-fringed white beaches that melt into the turquoise hues of the ocean. The smaller Kecil is less developed, which means simpler, smaller places to rest for the night, but also less crowded beaches and more affordable prices.
<br> </br>
Kecil is also home to the stunning Coral Bay beach (famous for its sunsets) and to the Sugar Wreck, a ship that sank in 2000 and has become a popular diving site. Although too new to have coral covering, the wreck is home to thriving marine life.
<br> </br>
Back in Besar, there's Turtle Beach, which can only be reached by boat. A protected area where sea turtles come to nest, the golden sands here are made for resting: sunbathing, picnicking, and then jumping into the blue waters for some snorkeling.
<br> </br>
Besar is also home to a number of unnamed small beaches lined with swaying palm trees and offering some of the softest white sand you'll find in Malaysia. The kilometer-long Main Beach has some of the best views over the turquoise-colored sea and nearby Kecil, while Teluk Pauh Beach offers privacy and powdery white sand.
<br> </br>
The Perhentian are also famous for the many trails that lead to the dense jungle and lush greenery that cover the center of the islands. You'll spot plenty of wildlife along the way, including long-tailed macaques, giant monitor lizards, flying squirrels, and langurs.

  	  <h2>Cát Bà Island, Vietnam</h2>
  	 <p>An ancient island located on the way to famous Ha Long Bay, Cat Ba might just be Vietnam's best-kept secret. Although the island is sometimes included as a cruise stop on the way to the bay, it has historically received little international tourism–though that is now changing as more people discover Cat Ba's many hiking trails, deep caves, and rugged cliffs perfect for rock climbing.
<br> </br>
The island's most stunning beach is cliffside Cat Co 3, which offers open views over the bay and picture-perfect white sand. Cat Co 3 is narrow, and the waters around are shallow (so not ideal for snorkeling) but the beach's sunset view and the fact that the space is never crowded make this a breathtaking destination in Vietnam.
