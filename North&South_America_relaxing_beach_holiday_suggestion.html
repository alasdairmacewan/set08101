  	 <h2>Ica, Peru</h2>

  	 <p>The coast near the oasis town of Ica in southern Peru is ruggedly romantic: outback-dry desert interspersed with rolling dunes running to dramatic craggy cliffs and long sweeps of sand. You’ll see more sea lions than people on the beaches – the most accessible of which lie around the little resort Paracas: where honey-yellow and coral-red bays are pounded by powerful Pacific waves. But at an average 15C the water is too cold for swims without wetsuit.

  	  <h2>Valparaíso, Chile</h2>
  	 <p>Chile is chilly – at least by South American standards – with temperatures in the country’s favourite beach resort of Valparaíso about the same as Brighton’s – on land and sea. And with the town’s long bays backed with skyscraper hotels, the sand is rarely empty. But if you’re after a seashore break from Santiago with plenty of bar-packed nightlife, there’s no better option. And with colourful colonial houses, steep, winding streets and edgy street art, the neighborhood of Cerro Concepción is a wanderer’s delight.
