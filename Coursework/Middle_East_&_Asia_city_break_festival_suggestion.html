  	 <h2>Holi</h2>

  	 <p>One of the most popular festivals in Asia is Holi. Holi typically falls in March, on the Hindu calendar’s full moon. Known as the “festival of colour”, “festival of spring” and “festival of love”, Holi is an ancient Hindu event that takes place across India celebrating the start of spring.
<br> </br>
Holi also signifies the importance of good over evil and it’s a time to end disputes with others. People gather around bonfires and perform religious rituals and pray to ward off evil. The following day, people meet in the streets to throw colourful powder at each other.
