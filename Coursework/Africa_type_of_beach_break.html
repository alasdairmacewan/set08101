	<h2>An Active Beach Holiday or A Quiet & Relaxing Beach Holiday?</h2>

  	 <h2>Active Beach Break</h2>
  	 <p>Picture yourself on a beach. For most of us, this picture sees us lying on the sand, feet towards the sea, probably with a cocktail in our hands. While the whole point of a holiday is usually to relax, that doesn’t mean we need to sit and do nothing for weeks – and keeping active with a few beach activities can make us feel much better when we get home again.
<br> </br>
People usually go on holiday to relax and unwind, but it doesn’t need to be a break from their fitness routines. Staying active while you’re away helps to maintain your health and fitness levels, so you don’t undo all the hard work you did to get yourself holiday-ready. A mix of mental wellbeing and physical activity is the ideal way to feel your best.
<br> </br>
There’s nothing better than exercising in the sunshine. Allowing your body to produce plenty of vitamin D to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy while keeping active is the perfect combination. Being surrounded by nature, beautiful scenery and the sound of the waves is an ideal place to exercise and it certainly makes a difference from a sweaty studio or gym class!

  	  <h2>Relaxing Beach Holidays</h2>
  	 <p>Sea water has incredible qualities when it comes to natural healing. People suffering from psoriasis and eczema often find the mineral content of the ocean can radically improve the condition of their skin.

But add into the equation the exfoliating qualities of sand and the fact that the sun is the best way of making sure we hit our daily dose of vitamin D, and a beach holiday is a guaranteed to leave you glowing, inside and out.
<br> </br>
With so few opportunities to stop, breathe and relax in our 24/7 society, who’s not in desperate need of more quality time with family and friends? 

The beach is the place for it. When the skies are blue, not only do the bright rays of the sun make it almost impossible to read your mobile screen and those work-related emails, but if you’ve got kids, it’s as easy as dispatching them with a bucket and spade while you make the most of that parasol, a good book and that rare opportunity to be present in the moment.
