  	 <h2>The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival</h2>

  	 <p>The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, or as the locals call it, Jazz Fest, is the celebration of the unique culture and heritage of New Orleans and Louisiana. Featuring an endless amount of music, succulent local and regional delicacies, one-of-a-kind handmade arts and crafts, second-line parades and so much more – there is something for everyone at Jazz Fest!

Over the years Jazz Fest has received many honors, including being named the Festival of the Year four times by Pollstar magazine. The Wall Street Journal says Jazz Fest “showcases a wider, deeper lineup of essential American musical styles than any festival in the nation…” and Life magazine has called Jazz Fest “the country's very best music festival.”

With 13 stages of soul-stirring music—jazz, gospel, Cajun, zydeco, blues, R&B, rock, funk, African, Latin, Caribbean, folk, and much more—the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival is a singular celebration. The event has showcased most of the great artists of New Orleans and Louisiana of the last half-century: Professor Longhair, Fats Domino, The Neville Brothers, Wynton Marsalis, Dr. John, Branford Marsalis, Harry Connick Jr., Ellis Marsalis, The Radiators, Irma Thomas, The Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Allen Toussaint, Buckwheat Zydeco, The Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Better Than Ezra, Ernie K-Doe, Vernel Bagneris, The Zion Harmonizers, Beausoleil, and many others.

  	  <h2>Carnaval Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</h2>
  	 <p>The Rio Carnival is undoubtedly the most famous party in the world and the most coveted event in the South American social calendar. Of all the cultural festivities, anywhere on the continent, this is the one that attracts the most visitors from all over the world. With its roots in 1000 CE Italy, the carnival is typically held in February (just before Lent in the Christian calendar) and this South American version is related to other world-famous carnivals like the one held in Venice, Italy. 
<br> </br>
Although celebrations are held in other South American nations, such as Bolivia, Peru, Argentina and Uruguay, the Rio Carnival is by far the largest, with almost two million people participating every day for the last four days of the two-week event. Nowadays, the Rio Carnival is the most anticipated dance-off of the year, with about 200 samba schools in the city competing for first place. Parties brimming with hypnotic music, unbelievable dancing, flamboyant floats, outlandish costumes, fantastic food and non-stop festivities are held all over the Brazilian city, culminating in the Sambadrome on the last, no-holds-barred night.
