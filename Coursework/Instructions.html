    <h2>Traveling</h2>
    <p>Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, not as many people have been able to escape the UK or where they live to go and explore the world. There are so many fantastic locations to go and explore and if Covid has taught us anything, it is that we must enjoy our freedoms. 	Therefore it is the idea behind this quiz, to ask a few simple questions to provide new inspirational ideas and places for people to go and explore. </p>
