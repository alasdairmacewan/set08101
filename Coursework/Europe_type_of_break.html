  	 <h2>City Breaks</h2>
  	 <p>Enjoy the non-stop urban lifestyle of a break to a city! City breaks offer you plenty to both see and do, and are perfect for people who are always on the go. Trips to cities offer plenty to see (just not much sea), from museums, shops, galleries, and landmarks. 
<br> </br>
Cities are usually very easy to navigate around, with a choice of both private and public transport available. Using the city's public transport usually makes it easier to fit as much into your break as possible. And if you ever get lost, maps are usually available, and many of the locals will often speak some English, so there is not too much to worry about!
<br> </br>
There is usually a large array of diverse restaurants in cities, offering international cuisine from all around the world, meaning you can eat whatever you fancy (within limits), and are not restricted to just the local food.
<br> </br>
Although city breaks can seem as though they have it all, they do come with their down sides. City breaks are not for relaxation! They are often busy and noisy, as they are always on the go. The noise of planes, trains, cars, and people are frequent noises that can be heard in cities.
<br> </br>
City breaks are usually a lot more expensive than beach holidays. Factors including food, accommodation, and transport usually charge tourists a lot more for their services in cities, than if you were to go further beyond them.

  	  <h2>Beach Holidays</h2>
  	 <p>Beach holidays are perfect for people who just need time out to relax to recharge their batteries. Avoid the hustle and bustle of city life, and soak up the sun, sea, and sand in a calm location, listening to the sounds of the waves lapping up on the shore.
<br> </br>
If you fancy a wander, local markets usually occur a couple of times a week in some outer towns and villages, which will let you explore the lifestyle and culture of the locals, snap up some local cuisine and products, and let you test put your knowledge of the local language.
<br> </br>
However, there are disadvantages to a beach side retreat. Holidays to beach locations are often found to be more restrictive than city breaks, as you are usually set away from the hustle and bustle of towns a city. This means that there is likely to be not as much of a variety of shops, restaurants, and landmarks as a break to a city.
<br> </br>
The language barrier may also be a problem for some in more rural beach locations. People in cities are more likely to be more diverse when it comes to language and communication. Locals in more rural locations and small villages are less likely to speech as much English. So donâ€™t forget to pack your phrase book!
