  	 <h2>Doha, Qatar </h2>

  	 <p>Undeservedly overlooked in favour of its headline-stealing neighbours, Doha is at once staunchly traditional and determinedly modern, a vibrant hub of art, culture and untouched desert landscapes.
<br> </br>
Once a quiet peninsula lined with sleepy fishing villages, Qatar has remained relatively under the radar for years. After striking oil in 1939, the country has spent the last few decades quietly investing its wealth (the government owns Harrods and Valentino, and has stakes in The Shard, Volkswagen, the Empire State Building and Sainsbury’s, to name just a few) and developing ambitious cultural projects like Education City, an academic initiative, and the National Museum of Qatar. In recent years, Doha has exploded into an exciting, cosmopolitan capital, while still embracing its nomadic Bedouin beginnings.
<br> </br>
It has an enviable collection of extravagant hotels (such as the eccentric Mondrian, which opened in 2017) and celebrity chef-led restaurants, but these luxury openings have never been at the expense of culture. Doha’s well-preserved central souk is the most picturesque in the Gulf, its surrounding desert is dotted with art sculptures and though it may have a glamorous edge, it’s a museum-rich city that will impress even the most discerning art critics and architecture buffs.

  	  <h2>Auckland, New Zealand</h2>
  	 <p>Auckland is a city with a lot of character. As New Zealand’s largest and most diverse city, it is definitely a place to visit if you’re looking to experience an array of different attractions. These 11 reasons to visit will show you why everyone should explore the City of Sails at least once.
<br> </br>
Aucklanders and outside visitors adore Waiheke Island because of its remarkable viticulture, stunning white-sand beaches, and jam-packed adventure activities. Getting to the island is as easy as catching a ferry from downtown — a scenic trip across the Hauraki Coast which usually takes around 40 minutes. As the residence of many artists and creative minds, Waiheke also has a particular bohemian flair to it: galleries and art walks are very much a part of the island’s appeal.
<br> </br>
Queenstown may be viewed as New Zealand’s adventure capital, but Auckland is a definite must-visit for keen adrenaline junkies. The list of adventure activities is quite extensive: the Sky Tower and the Harbour Bridge are among the favourite places for bungy jumpers, while the west coast is a great place for hiking and canyoning. Other exhilarating attractions to keep an eye out for include mountain biking, motorbike tours, helicopter rides, and sea kayaking.
