  	 <h2>Naxos</h2>

  	 <p>As a country with over 20,000 kilometers of coastline and many seas, Greece is a paradise for water sports fanatics. Blessed with many natural submarine wonders and over 6,000 islands of varying sizes, Greece has high-quality sea sport services to satisfy even the most demanding enthusiasts.
<br> </br>
Naxos is well-known as a wind sports destination, but we suggest that you go for a less obvious option and do a scuba diving session. Blue Fin Divers is an experienced diving center that offers diving sessions around Naxos and beyond. Explore things like the Express Samina wreck off the coast of Paros or an underwater cave; the sky is the limit.
