  	 <h2>Sunset Dhow Cruise, Mozambique</h2>
  	 <p>The ancient dhows that can be found in Mozambique are exactly what legends and fairy tales are made up of. Their unique silhouette has been dotting the eastern seaboard of Africa for centuries and they have been responsible for ferrying fishermen, sailors, merchants, and even pirates from one place to the other. Today, these tall-sailed dhows are used on the coasts of Kenya, Mozambique, Zanzibar and Tanzania and are incredibly popular among couples. With the warm breeze offering scents of cloves and vanilla from the surrounding islands and the setting sun leaving the skies around you in a colorful mess, dhows are known to offer some of the most romantic water experiences in Africa.

  	  <h2>Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe â€“ Fishing</h2>
  	 <p>If fishing is something that excites you, there are no shortage of fishing destinations in Africa. While places like Dullstroom, the fly-fishing capital of Africa, are incredibly famous, Bookmundi recommends a trip to Lake Kariba. It is the perfect place to catch tiger fish and enjoy a beautiful river adventure at the same time. 
<br> </br>
Simply rent a houseboat and sail down the lake, fishing as you please.
