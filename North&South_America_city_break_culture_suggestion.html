  	 <h2>New York City</h2>

  	 <p>The city is the birthplace of many cultural movements, including the Harlem Renaissance in literature and visual art; abstract expressionism (also known as the New York School) in painting; and hip hop, punk, salsa, freestyle, Tin Pan Alley, certain forms of jazz, and (along with Philadelphia) disco in music.
<br> </br>
A city and the cultural works it inspires are inextricably linked. Over time they become integral to that city’s identity, part of its fabric and how it is perceived in the popular imagination. But while cultural works often have cities at their centre, the manner in which they can be explored in order to further our understanding of that city is often undervalued. Here, we take a book, a film and a visual artwork, and use them to look at a particular aspect of a city’s identity at a particular time. The choices are in no way intended to be definitive but rather aim to breathe new life into both cities and artworks that we often think we know so well, and in doing so underline the value of culture in enhancing our appreciation of the world around us.

  	  <h2>Visit Peru</h2>
  	 <p>Peru is located on the east coast of the South American continent, next to the Pacific Ocean. It is a unique, multicultural and colourful destination, a country full of contrasts that come to light after discovering its diverse culture, history, geography, biodiversity and gastronomy; from the coastal lands of the capital and the dunes of Ica, crossing the Andes Mountain Range up to the Peruvian Amazon.
<br> </br>
Peru is home to the citadel of Machu Picchu, one of the seven wonders of the world, located outside Cuzco City in the forest brow. And even though Machu Picchu is one of the most visited sites in Peru, it alone is not enough to fully comprehend this exotic country. Here are five reasons why travelling to Peru is a lifetime experience:
