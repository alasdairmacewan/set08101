  	 <h2>Mombasa Carnival, Kenya</h2>
  	 <p>The Mombasa Carnival is the biggest and most engaging festival in Kenya and is organised by the Ministry of Tourism. The event which usually takes place in November revolves around two parades which converge on Moi Avenue with Mombasa's multicultural communities represented by floats, costumes, music and dance.
<br> </br>
<br> </br>
This sreet party cranks up the multicultural energy that normally pulses through Kenya’s second city. The largest coastal port in East Africa, Mombasa has been a popular stop-off for traders since at least the 12th century. It welcomed ships from as far afield as the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula and changed hands among the Arab-Swahilis, Portuguese, Omanis and Brits. Today, the Swahili centre’s stew of sights, sounds and smells reflects both sub-Saharan and Arabic influences.
<br> </br>
<br> </br>
During the carnival, your eardrums are as likely to be blasted by sassy Afropop as they are to be soothed by traditional religious songs. Many sound systems pump out taarab, which fuses the music of countries from Mozambique to Egypt.
<br> </br>
<br> </br>
The party revolves around two parades, which converge on main drag Moi Avenue. Mombasa’s melting pot of communities is represented by the floats, costumes and dancers, while stalls sell items ranging from woodcarvings to bootlegged reggae CDs. Artists from across Kenya join in the proceedings, making the carnival an inspiring introduction to East Africa’s diverse culture.

  	  <h2>Herman's Whale Festival, South Africa</h2>
  	 <p>The annual Hermanus Whale Festival is a celebration of the return of the southern right whales to the coastal waters of Southern Africa. It is a tribute to the legacy left to the town by Wendy the Whale whose story is about man's ability to live in harmony with nature as well as people's ability to come together as communities valuing the environment. All events and activities during the whale festival are focused to create awareness on how to protect the whales and all our marine wildlife who share our coastal waters.  The festival takes place at the end of September which is the peak of whale activity in the region.
<br> </br>
Every year, southern right whales migrate from their icy feeding grounds off Antarctica to warmer climates, reaching the South African Whale Coast in June and will stay till early December. These coastal waters will then team with the giant mammals, mating, calving, and rearing their young – and giving whale-watchers spectacular displays of raw power and elegant water acrobatics incredibly close to shore.
<br> </br>
Over a period of 3 days, this fishing village will once again burst into life when thousands of visitors descend upon the town to join in the festivities of this popular event. Accommodation establishments open their doors, restaurants dish up mouth-watering meals and the residents of Hermanus open their hearts in a warm welcome to visitors.
<br> </br>
Now in its 31st year and the 30th festival, the Hermanus Whale Festival is the oldest and largest festival on the South African whale coast calendar and while the whales are predominantly the star performers at the festival, these gentle giants will be joined on land by quality entertainers and musicians, an array of food stalls, kiddies activities, and events suitable for both the young and old. Enjoy the spectacles of these mammoth creatures.
