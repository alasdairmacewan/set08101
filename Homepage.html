	<h1>Safety Tips</h1>
	<body>
   	<h3>Share your itinerary with someone at home</h3>
    	<p>Before you head off, give a friend or family member a copy of your itinerary and flight details. If you don’t have a fully fleshed out itinerary, don’t worry. A rough idea of your movements is better than nothing. And keep in touch while you are away. On the road, many people post social media updates and messaging to share their journey with family and friends.</p>
    

	<h3>Photocopy or scan key documents</h3>
    	<p>I usually carry a photocopy of my passport ID page. There is also a scanned copy of this and my travel insurance documents stored in an email or on DropBox.</p>
    	
	<h3>Lock up your valuables</h3>
    	<p>For me, a key criterion for choosing a hotel is an in-room safe.
	One of the first things I do on arrival is to lock away my passport, documents, money and cards I don’t need, and other valuables. If there is not a safe in your room, the front desk will normally have one.</p> 
     
	<h3>Don’t flash your valuables</h3>
     	<p>Would you walk along the street waving £500 in crisp notes in the air? I didn’t think so. In the same way, don’t flash your expensive DSLR or smartphone. Be vigilant when you take them out to capture that perfect Instagram moment. Also, leave your diamond necklace and tiara at home.</p>
     
	<h3>Go easy on the alcohol</h3>
     	<p>Don’t get me wrong, I love a cheeky glass or two of booze whilst I am away. But as a solo  female traveller, I am responsible for my own safety and for getting myself back to the hotel.</h1>
     
	<h3>Be slow to trust</h3>
	<p>Whilst solo travel presents many opportunities for meeting new people, be savvy about how you do this. Perhaps you meet someone in a bar, restaurant or on a tour and they suggest meeting up later that evening? It may sound obvious but don’t agree to head off to some isolated location with them. Instead, suggest meeting up in a public place where there will be other people around.</p>
